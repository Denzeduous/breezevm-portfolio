## What is BreezeVM?
The Breeze Virtual Machine (BreezeVM or BVM) is a process virtual machine for a custom bytecode and instruction set (BVMAsm), similar to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). BreezeVM's bytecode (Breeze Bytecode, or BBC) is type-agnostic to natively support dynamically-typed languages.

Due to a compiler bug in Odin that invalidated the previous project, this project was quickly designed and developed in a month to meet the capstone's due date. Due to this, tests are severely lacking, as well as the implemented instructions.

GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/F0x1fy/BreezeVM).

## BreezeVM's Design
Breeze is broken up into two portions, the assembler (bvmasm) and the VM (bvm). The assembler handles turning `.bvmasm` files into `.bbc` files, then the VM reads said `.bbc` files and operates on them. Disregarding endianness, `.bbc` files are entirely platform-independent. A `.bbc` file could be compiled on Windows and run just the same on Mac, Linux/GNU, or any other operating system.

The design can be shown at a high level as:

### VM Overall Design
![BreezeVM showing the process, which starts at reading a .bbc file, converting the header into a readable format, pushing read-only data into the data segment, creating the stack, loading any foreign code libraries, then executing the bytecode.](BVM.png)

### Stack
The VM currently has a hard-coded stack size of 2KB (42 values). In a full release, this would be definable, or definable in the program itself.

### Data Values
The VM can contain any number of constant, read-only data. These are accessible through data offsets using the `CONST`-related instructions.

### Prepared Values
Instead of a set number of registers, BVM uses "prepared" values. The `PREPARE` instructions allow the program to push to the prepared values. Prepared values are used to pass values to some instructions and to procedures.

### Intrinsic Procedures
Intrinsic procedures are defined in the virtual machine and are accessible in BVMAsm through the `CALL` instruction, followed by the procedure used in the jump table. Currently, there is only one intrinsic procedure, which prints out prepared values to `stdout` and is used for both the Fibonacci test as well as the Hello World test.

### Scopes
Scopes are self-isolated chunks of code. The only way scopes interact is through pulling arguments from the parent scope. A child scope cannot access the stack of a parent scope.

### Blocks
Blocks are sub-sections of code within scopes. They can use the stack values of its parent scope and blocks. A block stores prepared values, so a block must be defined within a scope in order to use prepared values. Blocks also make managing prepared values within self-contained sections of code in a stack incredibly easy, removing the need to pull prepared values often.

## Breeze Bytecode Files
Breeze Bytecode files (`.bbc` files) have a custom format to make serializing and deserializing simple and efficient. These files are broken into two parts: The header section, and the bytecode section.

### BBC Header
A Breeze Bytecode header is broken up into several parts, some of variable length, and some of fixed length.

* 64 bits => Length of the entire header in bytes.

* 64 bits => Amount of procedure descriptors.

* 64 bits => Length of the procedure descriptors in bytes.

* N bits => An array of procedure descriptors. Code [here](https://github.com/F0x1fy/BreezeVM/blob/master/Source/BreezeVM/Types/interpreter.odin#L14). Name must be followed by a null terminator.

* 64 bits => Amount of foreign imports.

* 64 bits => Length of the foreign imports in bytes.

* N bits => An array of foreign import names. The names are null-terminated strings.

* 64 bits => Amount of data descriptors.

* 64 bits => Length of the data descriptors in bytes.

* N bits => An array of data descriptors. Code [here](https://github.com/F0x1fy/BreezeVM/blob/master/Source/BreezeVM/Types/stack.odin#L27).

* 64 bits => Length of read-only data in bytes. Though this CAN be computed by subtracted an offset from the header length and a u64, but this is kept here for consistency and ease of use.

* N bits => An array of bytes for the read-only data.

* 64 bits => Length of the binary.

* N bits => The executable binary.

### Breeze Bytecode
Though there are many possible instructions, due to time constraints, only a few instructions are implemented, and fewer have been tested. `<` and `>` are used to signify the types used in an instruction and `[` and `]` are used to name the parameters passed. Below are, at the time of writing, the valid instructions:

#### Constructs
There are a few non-instruction tokens that can be used in Breeze Bytecode. These are:

* Sections `.DATA` or `.CODE` (Tells the assembler whether the following code is for the data in the header or the bytecode)

* Procedures `.PROC <u64>[NUM_ARGS] <u64>[NUM_RETS]` (Creates a procedure with n number of arguments and m number of return values)

* Labels `:[name]` (Saves a label that can be accessed with `GOTO` and `GOTOIF`)

#### No-Bit Instructions
These instructions take no parameters. Due to this, they are called "no-bit" (though they take up the size of `size_of (Bytecode.Instruction)`)

* INVALID (Is not a valid instruction. Is only passed when there is an error lexing)

* GOTO `GOTO <name>[LABEL]` (Isn't really an instruction, but converts to a JMP)

* GOTOIF `GOTOIF <name>[LABEL]` (Isn't really an instruction, but converts to a JMPIF)

* EXIT `EXIT` (Exits a procedure, cleaning up any blocks and scopes)

* RETURN `RETURN` (Exits a procedure and passes its prepared values upwards, cleaning up any blocks and scopes)

* PUSH_SCOPE `PUSH_SCOPE` (Creates a new scope)

* POP_SCOPE `POP_SCOPE` (Deletes the current scope in context then proceeds through the parent)

* PUSH_BLOCK `PUSH_BLOCK` (Creates a new block)

* POP_BLOCK `POP_BLOCK` (Deletes the current block in context and proceeds through the parent)

* HALT `HALT` (Halts and exits the program)

#### No-Bit Multi-Value Instructions
These instructions take no parameters, but used multiple prepared values.

* PULL `PULL` (Pulls prepared values from the block onto the stack. This will always be appended to the stack)

* DELETE `DELETE` (Deletes all prepared values from the block)

* PULL_DELETE `PULL_DELETE` (Pulls prepared values from the block onto the stack, then deletes the prepared block. This will always be appended to the stack)

* ADD_MULTI_O `ADD_M` (Adds multiple prepared values. Does clear out the prepared values)

* SUB_MULTI_O `SUB_M` (Subtracts multiple prepared values. Does clear out the prepared values)

* MUL_MULTI_O `MUL_M` (Multiplies multiple prepared values. Does clear out the prepared values)

* DIV_MULTI_O `DIV_O` (Divides multiple prepared values. Does clear out the prepared values)

* MOD_MULTI_O `MOD_O` (Performs a standard modulus on multiple prepared values. Does clear out the prepared values)

#### 64-Bit Instructions
These instructions take a single 64-bit parameter.

* PREPARE_O `PREPARE <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Prepares a specific value on the stack for use in prepared-value and multi-value instructions)

* PREPARE_CONST_O `PREPARE_CONST <u64>[DATA_OFFSET]` (Prepares a specific value from read-only data based on the offset)

* JMP `JMP <i64>[BYTE_OFFSET]` (Jumps to a specific offset in the code. Note this is signed)

* REF_O `REF <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Prepares a Pointer-type value to specified stack location)

* CALL_O `CALL <u64>[PROC_CODE]` (Calls an intrinstic procedure from its procedure offset. Will pass all prepared values. Though this does output, output is not guaranteed as not all procedures return values)

* CALL_PROC_O `CALL_PROC <u64>[PROC_OFFSET]` (In code, this is `CALL_PROC <str>[PROC_NAME]`, but it gets assembled into the former. Calls a specific procedure from its procedure offset in the header. Will pass all prepared values)

#### 64-Bit Prepared Instructions
These instructions take a single 64-bit parameter as well as one or more prepared value(s).

* NOT `NOT <u64>[PREPARE_OFFSET]` (Inverts a boolean at specified location in the prepared values)

* JMPIF `JMPIF <i64>[BYTE_OFFSET]` (Jumps to a specific offset in the code IF all prepared conditions are true. If it not a boolean, it'll check to make sure it is not null. Note this IS signed)

#### 128-Bit Instructions
These instructions take two 64-bit parameters.

* COPY `COPY <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Copies first stack offset to second)

* CONST_TO `CONST_TO <u64>[DATA_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Pulls a data value based on its offset to the specified location on the stack)

* PULL_TO `PULL_TO <u64>[PREPARE_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Pulls prepared value based on its offset onto the specified location on the stack)

* ARG_TO `ARG_TO <u64>[ARG_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Pulls an argument from the parent scope to the specified stack location)

* ADD_O `ADD <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Adds two values on the stack)

* SUB_O `SUB <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Subtracts two values on the stack)

* MUL_O `MUL <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Multiplies two values on the stack)

* DIV_O `DIV <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Divides two values on the stack)

* MOD_O `MOD <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Performs a standard modulus on two values on the stack)

* EQUAL_O `EQUAL <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Checks to see if the first value is equal to the second value)

* GREATER_O `GREATER <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Checks to see if the first value is greater than the second value)

* LESSER_EQ_O `LESSER_EQ <u64>[STACK_OFFSET] <u64>[STACK_OFFSET]` (Checks to see if the first value is less than or equal to the second value)

## Examples
These examples use a reproducable Docker environment for testing. To run an example, simply navigate to `Test` and choose which directory you wish to test, then make sure to build the Docker environment with `make build`, then in `Test/Assembler`, run `make run` to run, and for `Test/VM`, you have the option of `make hello-world` for Hello World and `make fibonacci` for the Fibonacci sequence.

Here are two examples of Breeze working in its entirety with its current functionality:

### Hello World
The basics of the basics, Hello World shows the basic structure of a program. In here, this shows exactly how to use scopes and blocks within a program, as well as how read-only data can be stored and prepared.

#### BVMAsm
```
.DATA
STORE String "Hello, World!"

.CODE
PUSH_SCOPE
    PUSH_BLOCK
        PREPARE_CONST 0
        CALL 0
    POP_BLOCK
POP_SCOPE
```

#### Output
```
Completed binary in 0.239ms.                                       
Hello, World!
```

### Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a bit more complicated program than Hello World, showing how loops work, how procedure calls, as well as labels.

#### BVMAsm
```
.DATA
STORE Int 0 ; a
STORE Int 1 ; b
STORE Int 2 ; i
STORE Int 9 ; Seed

.CODE

.MAIN 0 0
PUSH_SCOPE
    PUSH_BLOCK
        PREPARE_CONST 3 ; Prepare the iteration count.

        CALL_PROC FIBONACCI

        CALL 0 ; Call `print_values` for the prepared values.

        HALT
    POP_BLOCK
POP_SCOPE

; Memory layout:
;   - 0 is i
;   - 1 is a
;   - 2 is b
;   - 3 is c
;   - 4 is n
;
; Code uses https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-fibonacci-numbers/
; (space optimized method 2) as reference.
.FIBONACCI 1 1
PUSH_SCOPE
    PUSH_BLOCK
        ARG_TO 0 4 ; n
        CONST_TO 0 1 ; a

        EQUAL 4 1
        NOT 0

        GOTOIF NOTEQUAL
            PREPARE 1
            RETURN

        :NOTEQUAL
        CONST_TO 2 0 ; i
        CONST_TO 1 2 ; b

        :FORLOOP
        DELETE

        ADD 1 2     ; a + b
        PULL_TO 0 3 ; c = a + b
        DELETE

        COPY 2 1 ; a = b
        COPY 3 2 ; b = c

        PREPARE 0
        PREPARE_CONST 1
        ADD_M
        PULL_TO 0 0
        DELETE

        LESSER_EQ 0 4

        GOTOIF FORLOOP

        DELETE
        PREPARE 2

        RETURN
    POP_BLOCK
POP_SCOPE
```

#### Output
```
Completed binary in 1.088ms.

## Limitations of BVM
Sadly, since BreezeVM had to be designed implemented in a month, there are quite a few limitations that have been imposed on it.

* Conversions do not work currently, so types must be monomorphized.

* Limited implemented instructions

* Almost no testing for edge cases

* Very few proper errors

* No debug mode

* No importing shared libraries or other BVMAsm code (the latter is implemented, but entirely untested)

* Does not account for endianness
